# CNN-Based-Dog-Breed-Classifier-with-Transfer-Learning

## Project Overview
This project develops a **deep learning model** to classify dog breeds from images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained to identify multiple dog breeds with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- Utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification.
- Implements **data augmentation** to improve model robustness and handle varying image orientations.
- Includes **transfer learning** with pre-trained models to boost accuracy and efficiency.
- Provides performance evaluation with metrics like **accuracy** and **confusion matrix** to analyze classification results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV** for image processing.
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing results.

## Objective
The primary goal is to accurately classify dog breeds from images, utilizing CNNs for their ability to learn and recognize complex patterns in image data.
